# Symbl.Insights.Audio

The Symbl Conversations Insights with the automated audio file for Summary, Topics, Followups etc.

# Introduction

The sample program uses the Sybml Async Text API and extracts the summary and other related insights such as Topics, Followups etc. However, you can use the same technique for processing the audio/video files too.

What is interesting in this demo is, Once we process and get the Sybml Insights, we are going to run our custom Speech to Text convertor for generating the audio files for Summary, Topics, Followups etc.

# How to run?

Please make sure to register and obtain the Symbl AppId and AppSecret from https://platform.symbl.ai/

Use the AppId and AppSecret in the Program.cs

Run the sample program to get the audio insights. You should be able to see the audio file getting generated in the "bin" folder.
